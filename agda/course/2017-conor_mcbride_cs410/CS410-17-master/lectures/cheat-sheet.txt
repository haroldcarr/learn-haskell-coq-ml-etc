Agda / Emacs Cheat Sheet
------------------------

This document will give you an overview of commonly used Agda, as well as Emacs, commands.

C-     = Ctrl
M-     = Alt/Esc
buffer = file
hole   = place where an expression is expected.

Emacs:
------
C-x C-f   : find a file to load
C-x C-s   : Save buffer
C-x C-c   : Exit emacs

C-s       : Search forward for some text
C-r       : Search backward for some text
C-/       : Undo
C-a       : Jump to start of the line
C-e       : Jump to end of the line
M-<       : Jump to top of the buffer
M->       : Jump to end of the buffer
M-}       : Jump forwards a paragraph (blank line after block of text)
M-{       : Jump backwards a paragraph

Agda:
-----
C-c C-l   : Load (type check) the current buffer.
C-c C-f   : Jump (forward) to active hole
C-c C-b   : Jump (backward) to active hole
C-c C-,   : Show goal type, and context of current hole
C-c C-.   : Show goal type, context, and type of expression in the hole.
C-c C-spc : Fill the hole with the given expression
C-c C-r   : Refine the hole
C-c C-a   : Search for a proof and fill it in the hole if there is at least 1.
            -l       : list the possible proofs
            -s 10 -l : skip the first 10 proofs
C-c C-c   : Case split the given variable(s) into its possible constructors
C-c C-n   : Evaluate an expression
C-c C-d   : Infer a type for an expression

C-c C-x C-d : Kill Agda - useful if agda gets a bit fussy
              (Can use C-c C-l to start Agda again when needed)
C-c C-x C-r : Kill and restart Agda
