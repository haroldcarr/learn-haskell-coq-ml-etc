Fin n : unsigned number with non-inclusive upper bound of n.
name "Fin" says number is finitely bounded.

FZ and FS are constructors of Fin, corresponding to Z and S Nat constructors.
Can use numeric literals, as with Nat.

-----------------------



The type-level numbers in vappend are compiletime: flow of control determined from constructors of first vector.

> t2 = U.t "t2"
>    (vappend (6 :> 5 :> 4 :> V0) (3 :> 2 :> 1 :> V0))
>    (6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :> 1 :> V0)

Sometimes numbers needed at runtime. E.g., chopping a vector in two:

vchop :: Vec (m :+ n) x -> (Vec m x, Vec n x)

Need m at runtime.

But Haskell’s dependent ∀ quantifier is for implicit and static things.

Standard solution : define runtime replica of static data as a singleton GADT.

> data Natty :: Nat -> * where
>   Zy :: Natty Z
>   Sy :: Natty n -> Natty (S n)

Each type level n in Nat kind has corresponding type Natty n.

The ‘Π-types’, often written (x : S) -> T, of dependent type theory abstract dependently over explicit dynamic things.

Simulate in Haskell by abstracting dependently at the type level and non-dependently over singleton representative.

> vchop :: Natty m
>       -> Vec (m :+ n) a
>       -> (Vec m a, Vec n a)
> vchop  Zy          xs  = (V0     , xs)
> vchop (Sy k) (x :> xs) = (x :> ys, zs)
>   where (ys, zs) = vchop k xs

> t3 = U.t "t3"
>    (vchop (Sy (Sy Zy)) (6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :> 1 :> V0))
>    ( 6 :> 5 :> V0
>    , 4 :> 3 :> 2 :> 1 :> V0
>    )

To write:

vtake :: Nat -> Vec (m :+ n) a -> Vec m a
vtake  Z          xs  = V0
vtake (S k) (x :> xs) = x :> vtake k xs

Need to tell GHC how to instantiate n in the recursive call
(to reason about addition : (m :+ ) is injective.
- To GHC, it is just an unknown axiomatised function.
- Not a problem in vchop, because relaying the suffix, zs, from the recursive output to the result makes clear that the same n is needed in both places.
- n is not needed at run time, but without it there is no way to see that the program makes sense.
- summary: there are data that, despite being static, must be made explicit. One way : ‘proxy types’
