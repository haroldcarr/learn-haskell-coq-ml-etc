How to use Phantom Types and Existential Types in Production

------------
description:

Phantom types are a way to carry (possibly domain-specific) information in types.
Existential types are a way to hide information from places where those types are used.
This talk will develop a small application that:
- parses and validates user input
- uses phantom types to
  - turn validated data into types that carry "proofs" of that validation
  - use functions that require those proofs to be called
- uses existential types to
  - hide the state of pure computations from the IO layer that must pass that state
    back into the pure layer later
  - ensure the app can only make valid state transitions (a.k.a., "type-aligned sequences")
By the end of the talk you should understand the often used phrases
- "make illegal values unrepresentable" -- via phantom types
- "enforce abstraction boundaries in the type system" -- via existential types
