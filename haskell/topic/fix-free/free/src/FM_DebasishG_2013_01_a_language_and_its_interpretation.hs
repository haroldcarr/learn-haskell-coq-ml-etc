separation of concerns between pure data and its processing

Monads generally don't compose.
Mmonads restricted to a particular form support a sum type that composes.

Wouter Swierstra

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.4131

describes this as

Term f a = Pure a | Impure (f (Term f a))

Monads of pure values OR an impure effect, constructed using f.

When f is a functor, Term f is a monad.

In this case, Term f is free monad (the left adjoint to forgetful functor f).

What makes a monad free: see Edward Kmett's response:
https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DebasishGhosh/posts/g9LASrMjeFS

Free monad is the freeest object possible that's still a monad.

Composition

Free monads compose.  Can build larger abstractions of pure data and but still monad properties.

Free monad is pure. Can put impurities into processing of that monad.

Example: interpreter for Joy-like concatenative language : uses stack for its computation.

Derives 'Functor'.
Free monads are general way of turning functors into monads.
(Required for implementing forgetful functor adjoint of free monad.)

Knowing something is a free monad helps transform an operation over
the monad (the monad homomorphism) into an operation over the functor
(functor homomorphism).

Define free monad over JoyOperator using Control.Monad.Free:

data Free f a = Pure a | Free (f (Free f a))

{-
Joy operators as operations over free monads.

Note: 'liftF' lifts an operator (which is a Functor) into the context of a free monad.

liftF :: Functor f => f a -> Free f a

free moand has forgetful functor as left adjoint.
Unlifting from the monad to the functor via:
retract function ..

retract :: Monad f => Free f a -> f a

retract . liftF = id

push :: Int -> Free JoyOperator ()
push n = liftF $ Push n ()

add = liftF $ Add ()

mult :: Free JoyOperator ()
mult = liftF $ Mult ()

dup :: Free JoyOperator ()
dup = liftF $ Dup ()

end :: Free JoyOperator ()
end = liftF End

-- can also combine operators (since monads, can use 'do')

incr :: Free JoyOperator ()
incr = do push 1; add
